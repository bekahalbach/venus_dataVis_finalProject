# venus_dataVis_finalProject

A simple interactive map of the surface of Venus that allows the user to zoom in / rotate the surface, as well as exaggerate the topography by small amounts with up / down key presses. 
The vti file must be downloaded with the python file because that is the topographic dataset. Large negative values in the topographic map are areas of "no data" which I found difficult
(impossible?) to remove.
